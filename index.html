      <h1>Paul Alexander Zupan</h1>
      <p>
        Hello! My name is Paul Zupan. I like making little games and other
        pieces of software, and I just like learning about software in general.
        I'm in high school right now, and I'm hoping to get a computer
        engineering degree in the future and make a career in the tech
        industry.
      </p>
      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <p>
        I have several cool projects to show off, most of them are in C/C++ or
        Rust. Most of them are also graphical applications, but some are CLI.
        At the moment, my flagship project is a sorting algorithm visualizer,
        and it's available under lunathanel's GitHub page. The link to the
        GitHub page of my partner, Nathanael Lu, can be found
        <a href="https://github.com/lunathanael"> here,</a> and the link to the
        sorting visualizer can be found
        <a href="https://github.com/lunathanael/visualizing-sorting">here.</a>
      </p>

        </a>
      </h3>
      <p>
        Have you ever been on YouTube and seen a video of one of those sorting
        algorithm visualizers, where there is a series of bars which represent
        numbers and they get moved around until they make a triangle? This is
        basically that. This is my flagship project and is in active
        development.
      </p>
